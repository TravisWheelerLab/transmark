# transmark
A benchmark for translated sequence database search tools (searching protein queries against DNA target that contains protein-coding DNA)

We use a "git flow" workflow. We have two active branches:
 * **master** will be the stable transmark release branch. 
 * **develop** is the transmark development branch


To clone your own copy of transmark source code repository for the first time:

```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/transmark
   $ cd transmark
   $ git checkout develop
```

To contribute to transmark development, you want to be on the
**develop** branch, which is where we are currently integrating
feature branches. For more information, see the
[transmark wiki](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/transmark/wiki).
